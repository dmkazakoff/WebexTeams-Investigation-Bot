###### **Cisco CTR API Investigation Bot for Webex Teams**

This is a demonstration of a Proof of Concept webex Chat Bot, leveraging Cisco Threat Response API to do investigations, correlation and enrichment of submitted IoCs.

This script will use a Webex Teams Room to log every message sent to and from your Bot. So you will also need to create a room in Webex Teams and include your new Bot in it. Use this [API call](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/rooms/list-rooms) to find the roomId.

4. RoomID (Use [this](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/rooms/list-rooms) API call to find it), which you've created and invited your freshly created bot into it.
